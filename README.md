A simple Discord bot made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org), using JavaScript and SQLite.</br>
I wanted to learn some JavaScript back in 2017, so I started this project on my free time. It was a lot of fun, and I even ended up making some custom-made Discord bots for a few friends later on.

## Configuration file
If by any reason you wanted to use this bot, this is how the `config.json` file should look like.
```json
  {
    "token":"DISCORD_TOKEN",
    "prefix":"!",
    "ownerId":"<@YOUR_DISCORD_ID>", 
    "lang":"english",
    "welMsg":"Welcome to the server <USER>!",
    "byeMsg":"<USER> left the server :(",
    "YouTubeAPI_key":"YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
  }
  ```
